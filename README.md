# FizzBuzz-Numbers

Java application to generate FizzBuzz numbers.

Numbers that are exact multiples of 3, or that contain 3, must print a string containing "Fizz"
   For example 9 -> "...Fizz..."
   For example 31 -> "...Fizz..."

Numbers that are exact multiples of 5, or that contain 5, must print a string containing "Buzz"
   For example 10 -> "...Buzz..."
   For example 51 -> "...Buzz..."
   
Numbers that satisfy both conditions, must print a string containing "FizzBuzz"
